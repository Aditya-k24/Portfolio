I'm thrilled to share that my latest research paper, titled **"Flowchart Generation and Mind Map Creation using Extracted Summarized Text,"** has been officially published in the proceedings of the esteemed **ICRASET 2023: International Conference on Recent Advances in Science & Engineering Technology**!

## Overview of the Research

In this study, we explore the transformative potential of technology in converting text into visual representations like **mind maps**, **flowcharts**, and **concise summaries**. Our research emphasizes the importance of graphical representations in enhancing **information retention** and **comprehension**.

By leveraging **machine learning** and **deep learning** algorithms, we devised a system to extract text from sources such as **images** and **PDFs**, and convert it into user-preferred visual formats. The practical applications of this approach are vast, benefiting both **academic** and **professional realms** by facilitating the efficient summarization of complex documents.

## Key Techniques Explored

- **OCR** for text extraction  
- **T5 Transformer Model** for text summarization  
- **Flowchart Creation** based on phrase relationships  
- **Mind Map Generation** using **NLTK** and **NetworkX** modules  

## Insights and Implications

Our project provides a powerful means to convert text into **visual formats**, fostering better comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. This research holds immense value in improving **learning** and **decision-making** processes across diverse domains, from academia to business.
