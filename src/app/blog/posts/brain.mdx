# üß† A Novel Approach for Brain Stroke Detection and Segmentation  

I am thrilled to share our research paper titled **"A Novel Approach for Brain Stroke Detection and Segmentation using BatNN-K-C Means Framework"**, co-authored with **Preksha Khatri**, **Gautam Mehendale**, and **Kiran Bhowmick**. This study introduces a cutting-edge methodology to enhance the detection and segmentation of brain strokes in **CT scans**, leveraging **Bat-Optimized Neural Networks (BatNN)** and **K-C means clustering**.

## üìö **Abstract**  

The paper presents a two-step methodology for stroke detection and segmentation:  
1. **Detection Phase**: Using **BatNN**, which integrates neural networks with bat-inspired optimization techniques, achieving a detection accuracy of **91%**.  
2. **Segmentation Phase**: Applying **K-C means clustering**, a combination of K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms, to segment stroke-affected regions with **87% accuracy**.  

This hybrid framework significantly outperforms traditional methods and is robust against noise and variations in CT images, offering a promising tool for early stroke diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

## üî¨ **Key Contributions**  

1. **Introduction of BatNN**:  
   A neural network optimized using the **Bat Algorithm**, inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency in stroke detection.  

2. **K-C Means for Segmentation**:  
   Combining K-means clustering with fuzzy C-means to delineate stroke-affected regions from healthy tissue in CT scans, providing nuanced segmentation results.  

3. **Dataset**:  
   Utilized a **Kaggle dataset** comprising 2,500 annotated brain CT images (1,500 normal and 1,000 stroke-affected), split into an 80-20 ratio for training and validation.  

4. **Validation and Metrics**:  
   Compared traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) with BatNN, showcasing superior performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
