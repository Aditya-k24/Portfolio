I am excited to announce that I participated in the 48-hour hackathon *"NIRMAN 2023: Bring Ideas to Life"*, an incredible experience where I collaborated with my talented teammates Aditya Kulkarni, Heet Zatakia, Meet Pithadia, and Deshna Gandhi.

## Teamwork and Collaboration

Our team was shortlisted among 1100+ participants from across India. We were selected for the *Health-Care Domain*, where our task was to develop an application that allows users to monitor their body vitals using mobile sensors. 

## The Solution We Built

We successfully developed an application capable of tracking the user's body vitals, leveraging mobile sensors. After brainstorming ideas for further scaling, we envisioned it as a *"One stop solution for all medical needs"*. Despite the technical challenges, we also pitched a business model alongside our application, and the judges were notably impressed by both our UI design and business model.
