## Project Overview

This research delves into the innovative integration of **computer vision** and **cybersecurity**, leveraging **generative adversarial networks (GANs)** for **data augmentation**. By applying **image processing** techniques to analyze network traffic visually, we accelerate threat detection, achieving faster and more effective results compared to traditional methods.

### Key Contributions:
- Novel application of **GANs** to enhance data augmentation for threat detection.  
- Use of **image-based analysis** for network traffic, enabling quicker identification of potential security threats.  
- Rigorous experimentation validating the efficacy and practicality of our methodology.  

## My Role in the Project

As part of this journey, I was responsible for:
- **Dataset management** to ensure quality and relevance.  
- Conducting an extensive **literature survey** to ground the research in existing knowledge.  
- Contributions to **image processing techniques** that formed the core of the threat detection process.  

## Acknowledgments

This project was a remarkable collaboration with the incredibly talented **Prateek Ranka**, **Ayush Shah**, **Nivan Vora**, and our mentor, **Dr. Nilesh Patil**. The diversity of experiences and perspectives within the team enriched our discussions and propelled the project forward. I am deeply grateful for their dedication and expertise.  

## Future Prospects

This work opens new doors in the field of cybersecurity, combining cutting-edge **machine learning** and **computer vision** techniques to improve threat detection and mitigation processes. I'm excited to explore further applications and advancements in this domain!
