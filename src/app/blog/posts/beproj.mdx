I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of our **Final Year Project: "CareerPlus AI"** ðŸŽ‰. This project represents a major leap forward in the job search landscape, offering a comprehensive platform that revolutionizes how job seekers navigate their career paths.

## Overview of the Project

**CareerPlus AI** is designed to be a person-centric solution, developed in collaboration with my talented teammates **Meet Pithadia** and **Varun Vekaria**, under the mentorship of **Sudhir Bagul Sir**. Our platform aims to simplify the job search process and provide tailored solutions for today's evolving job market.

### Key Features

## My Contributions

I was responsible for developing the **recommendation system** and the **user interface** of the platform. One of my key contributions was designing the **course recommendation system**, which identifies skill gaps and suggests relevant courses to help users enhance their qualifications for desired jobs.
